    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

      "\n",
      "The olive, a seemingly unassuming fruit, holds a position of profound significance in modern society that extends far beyond its culinary applications.  Its history is intertwined with human civilization, its cultivation shaping landscapes, economies, and cultures across millennia.  From the Mediterranean basin, where it originated, to global markets, the olive and its derivatives – olive oil, olives for consumption, and olive pomace – continue to play vital roles in nutrition, economics, and cultural heritage. This essay will explore the multifaceted importance of olives in the contemporary world, examining its contributions to health, agriculture, industry, and cultural identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most widely recognized contribution of olives to modern society is undoubtedly their nutritional value.  Olive oil, extracted from the fruit, is a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet, renowned for its health benefits and associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes.  This is largely attributed to its high monounsaturated\n"

      "He leaped, his lithe body a blur of red fur.  He stretched, his paws scrabbling at the smooth stone, but the grapes remained tantalizingly out of reach.  He tried again, his muscles straining, his breath catching in his throat.  He jumped and leaped, a frantic, furry acrobat, but the grapes mocked him with their unattainable sweetness.\n",

He hadn’t given up because he thought the grapes were sour. He’d given up because he couldn't reach them.  The sourness was a convenient excuse, a mask for his own failure.  And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the land, Finley knew that the true bitterness resided not in the grapes, but in his own unfulfilled hunger.\n",

      "Bartholomew, a ginger tabby with a perpetually grumpy expression, had always considered his life perfectly adequate. Sunbeams, a steady supply of tuna, and the occasional head scratch from his human, Amelia, were all he desired. However, one fateful Tuesday, a stray feather, imbued with the magic of the wind, drifted through his window and landed on his nose. Suddenly, Bartholomew felt a yearning, a need for something...more. \n",
      "\n",
      "He watched Amelia leave for work, a yearning growing in his chest. He knew what he had to do. He was going on an adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He slipped out the window, his whiskers twitching with excitement. The world outside was a symphony of smells - blooming lilacs, damp earth, and the enticing aroma of fish from the nearby market. He followed his nose, a fearless explorer in a world of towering legs and rumbling engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "His adventure led him to the park, a verdant paradise teeming with feathered friends. He stalked a squirrel, a majestic hunter in the dappled sunlight, before realizing he had no real intention of catching it. He simply enjoyed the thrill of the chase. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, a peculiar sight caught his eye. A group of pigeons huddled around a forgotten pastry, their eyes glinting with greed. Bartholomew, never one to shy away from a good meal, decided to join the feast. A flurry of feathers and a few squawks later, he had successfully claimed his share, his stomach purring with contentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spent the rest of the day exploring, his whiskers brushing against the leaves, his paws padding on the sun-warmed pavement. He met a friendly dog, a lumbering beast with a wagging tail and a playful bark. They sniffed each other cautiously, then settled into a comfortable truce, two adventurers sharing a moment of quiet understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the park, Bartholomew felt a pang of longing for his home. He knew Amelia would be worried, and he was, after all, a creature of comfort. He found his way back to the window, his heart a little lighter, his whiskers a little wiser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amelia greeted him with a sigh of relief and a scolding tone, but her eyes held a glimmer of amusement. Bartholomew, curled up on his favorite cushion, purred contentedly. He had tasted adventure, but the warmth of home was truly what he craved.  He was a cat, after all, a creature of routine and affection, and he wouldn't trade his cozy life for all the feathers in the world. But he knew, deep down, that his adventure was just beginning. The world was a vast, exciting place, and Bartholomew, the ginger tabby with a grumpy expression, was ready to explore it, one feather at a time. \n",
